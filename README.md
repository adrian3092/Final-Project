# JavaScript (Full Stack Development)

### This is my final project for the JavaScript (Full Stack Web Development) course offered through NYU's School of Professional Studies.

The requirements for the project are:
- the use of the document object model to change element content or style
- the use of event listeners and event handlers to trigger processing
- a form to collect data
- form field validation prior to submission
- the use of client side cookies or Web Storage to save data
- access previously saved data and display on a different page
- some use of DHTML
